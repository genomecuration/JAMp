One could download and use the latest UniRef/UniProt database from 

ftp://toolkit.genzentrum.lmu.de/pub/HH-suite/databases/hhsuite_dbs

OR

https://sourceforge.net/projects/jamps/files/
e.g. 
swissprot_50kclus.tar.bz2

If you use the large UniProt database 
a) may want to remove the hypothetical and transposons from it which is
a gruelling process
b) put up with a time-consuming hhblits process
c) use the databases at https://sourceforge.net/projects/jamps/files/.
They have been produced using refseq and kclust. In the case of fungi, 
hypotheticals are left in because they constituted half the database 
(seems most fungal data are hypothetical!)

For what it is worth, I mostly use the Uniprot database (option B) when annotating 
non-model taxons (e.g. corals) and the RefSeqs when annotating insects or fungi.

BTW, if you multiple CPUs, I recommend you install and use parallel bzip2 (pbzip2).
eg.
apt-get install pbzip2 # debian/ubuntu
pbzip2 -kdvl [yourdatabase].tar.bz2
or pbzip2 -kdvp[number of cpus] [yourdatabase].tar.bz2
tar -xf [yourdatabase].tar
rm -f [yourdatabase].tar
