Requirements
Two symlinks has to be made for this program to work. they are database.php and genome.php . The decision to create the symlink is based on the database that needs to be viewed.
Example:
To view chado database
cd ws/
ln -s chado_genes4all.php database.php
ln -s chado_genes4all.genome.php genome.php

System Requirements:
Webserver - Apache 2
PHP 5.5
php5-pgsql

Please note that (currently) your PHP must be setup so that no warnings are emitted;

i.e. edit /etc/php5/apache2/php.ini find and set the error_reporting variable to:
error_reporting = E_COMPILE_ERROR|E_RECOVERABLE_ERROR|E_ERROR|E_CORE_ERROR

And restart apache (sudo apache2ctl restart).

In the next version we will try to make sure this is not needed...
