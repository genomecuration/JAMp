# This is a simple script which will carry out all of the basic steps
# required to make a PSIPRED prediction. Note that it assumes that the
# following programs are available in the appropriate directories:
# seq2mtx - PSIPRED V2 program
# psipred - PSIPRED V2 program
# psipass2 - PSIPRED V2 program

# NOTE: Script modified to be more cluster friendly (DTJ April 2008)
