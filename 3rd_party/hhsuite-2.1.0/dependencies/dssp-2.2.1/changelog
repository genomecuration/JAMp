2.2.1
- Bug fix in mmCIF import code.

2.2.0
- Added support for reading mmCIF files.

2.1.0
- Changed the assignment of helices. A pi-helix now takes precedence over
  an alhpa helix. This is based the article: Cooley, R.B. et al.,
  Evolutionary Origin of a Secondary Structure: π-Helices as Cryptic but
  Widespread Insertional Variations of α-Helices That Enhance Protein
  Functionality, J. Mol. Biol (2010).

2.0.5
- Several small tweaks based on feedback

2.0.4
- No longer add ligands to a chain after a TER record
- Added a man page

2.0.3
- Accept duplicate PDB sequence numbers when they cross a chain barrier

2.0.2
- Support for more than 9999 residues, write out residue nr correctly,
	truncate bridgepair number to 4 positions (suboptimal solution...)
