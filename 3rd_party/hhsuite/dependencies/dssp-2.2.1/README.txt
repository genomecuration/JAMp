This README is part of the source code distribution of DSSP 2.0

To build the mkdssp executable, you need a recent C++ compiler
capable of compiling C++0x code. You also need a recent version
of the Boost libraries, we are currently using version 1.46.1.

The makefile reads a make.config file containing site specific
settings. This make.config file is created if it doesn't exist
when running make.

Please let me know if there are any problems with this code.
