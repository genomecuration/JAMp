/*	wn_bool is a predefined type in C++, that behaves differently from an
**  int.  For historical and possibly temporary reasons, we are defining
**  it to be an int in C++ as well as C.  This may change.
**	If you are using the STL and possibly other C++ packages, redefining
**  wn_bool to an int will screw things up.  To avoid this, compile with
**  "-DWN_LEAVE_BOOL_ALONE" set on your command line.  Wnlib has been
**  tested using natural C++ wn_bools, and will work.
**	wn_bool must be defined for C, because wnlib uses the type 'wn_bool' all
**  over the place, and C doesn't define a wn_bool type. */
