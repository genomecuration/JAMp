PBS scripts to process data with HHblits on a cloud. For annotaton, see and cp these scripts in your directory
 hhblits_mpi.pbs #edit if not using PBS (e.g. SGI/LSF)
 hhblits_mpi.sh # the only script to edit and use to launch, i.e. do "bash hhblits_mpi.sh"

HHblits is distributed here, please use this version as I may have edited the source to fix some bugs

For clustering you will need to harvest the a3m files, make a database and then search against itself (without multiple rounds, ie. -n 1). See 
1. hhsearch_split_output.pl
2. hhsearch_mkdatabase.pbs
3. do_hhsearch_custom.pl / hhsearch.qsub.main.pbs





The rest of the files are probably of no use to you.
