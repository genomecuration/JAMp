    Theming and language support: because not every community is the same!
    Performance improvements: we haven't done any work on improving performance and there are some clear low hanging fruits
	* for example, each request makes a new connection to the psql server; there clearly ought to be a single live connection (even with pgbouncer)
    Better and more powerful graphs: our graph user-interface can use improvements including more user-interactions.
	* including fixing some issues with existing graphs
    More data mining: currently only ontology functional annotations are searchable. Some user-interface work can vastly improve user experience by e.g. allowing users to search for genes with particular expression profiles or network memberships.
    More data types: we have in-silico annotation, networks and gene expression experiments covered but we still lack phylogenies, wet-lab experiments (e.g. knock-outs) and other functional experiments.
    More use-cases: because there is no reason why the Tree of Life can't have a JAMp!
